## Commands

- `mkdocs new <dir-name>` - Create a new project
- `mkdocs serve` - Start the live-reloading docs server
- `mkdocs build` - Build the documentation site
- `mkdocs -h` - Print help message and exit

## Repository Layout

```text
docs/
│   README.md        # This file
│   mkdocs.yml       # MkDocs configuration file (site settings, navigation, theme)
│
├── docs/            # Source markdown files for documentation (each .md = a site page)
│
└── site/            # Output directory generated by `mkdocs build` (static site, ignored by VCS)
```

**Note:**

- Edit content in `docs/docs/` and configuration in `docs/mkdocs.yml`.
- The `site/` folder is auto-generated and should not be edited directly.

# Mean Docs CI/CD

## Azure Static Web Apps Deployment

### Overview

This repository uses a GitHub Actions workflow to build and deploy the documentation site to Azure Static Web Apps on every push to the `main` branch that affects the `docs/` directory. The workflow ensures that documentation changes are automatically published and available.

### Prerequisites

- Azure Static Web Apps resource created and configured.
- `AZURE_STATIC_WEB_APPS_API_TOKEN_HAPPY_BUSH_0CAC3720F` secret set in the repository for deployment authentication.
- Documentation source and built site located in the `docs/` directory.

### Flow of the Workflow

1. **Trigger:**

   - On push to `main` affecting `docs/**`.

2. **Checkout:**

   - Checks out the repository code, including submodules if any.

3. **Build and Deploy:**

   - Uses the `Azure/static-web-apps-deploy` GitHub Action to build and deploy the documentation site.
   - The `app_location` and `output_location` are set to `./docs/site` (the built static site directory).
   - The deployment is authenticated using the Azure Static Web Apps API token secret.

4. **Environment:**
   - The workflow runs in the `Documentation` environment for audit and control.
